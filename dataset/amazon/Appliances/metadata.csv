Most important, it is safe for use with food., <span class=""a-text-bold"">Components:</span> T304 has a minimum of 10 percent chromium, 8 percent nickel, a maximum of 0.8 percent carbon, and more than 50 percent iron. The exact proportions of these and other trace elements depend on the specific uses planned for end product., <span class=""a-text-bold"">Rust Resistant:</span> An important characteristic of T304 that makes it suitable for food use is that it is corrosion-resistant. Chromium binds oxygen on the surface and protects the iron component from oxidation (rust)., <span class=""a-text-bold"">Long-Lasting:</span> The first use of T304 was in brewing and milk production but it was adopted rapidly throughout the food processing industry. T304 products will last several human lifetimes when properly maintained., <span class=""a-text-bold"">Heat and Cold Resistance: </span>Critically important for food and beverage applications, food grade silicone maintains its properties in both extreme heat and extreme cold.

It will have a metal probe with a sharp point which is pushed into the meat. It should be connected by a flexible heat-resistant silicone cable to oven control board andamp; display. Some brand models have programmed for auto cooking with the meat probe., <span class=""a-text-bold"">Use:</span> The probe can be inserted into the meat before starting cooking, and cooking continued until the desired internal temperature is reached. Alternatively the meat can be cooked for a certain time and taken out of the oven, and the temperature checked before serving. The tip of the probe should be in the thickest part of the meat, but not touching bone, which conducts heat and gives an overestimate of the meat temperature., <span class=""a-text-bold"">Temperature:</span>, Beef, Lamb, Veal (RARE 125F, MEDIUM 145F, WELL DONE 160F), Meaty Fish (RARE 125F, MEDIUM 140F, WELL DONE 150F), PORK, Sausage (WELL DONE 150-160F)",MaxRed,8843

Complete with a reversible door, the Koldfront built-in ice maker is a simple addition to any well-designed kitchen or home bar. At a height of 32.8"" and equipped with a front venting system, the Koldfront KIM450BL can be built in under most counters and it also has finished sides if you wish for it to stand on its own.

With a large capacity interior, the 25 lbs. of storage space allows you to hold ice in preparation for entertaining guests or hosting parties. The adjustable leveling legs ensure that this Koldfront ice maker will fit perfectly in any room, whether it is built into custom cabinetry or as a freestanding kitchen unit. Including a removable ice bin with an ice scoop, this unit would make a great addition among your kitchen appliances. We highly recommend purchasing the AquaPure In-Line Icemaker Ice and Water Filter (AP717) to increase the performance and overall longevity of this unit. Not only does it help the water pump work more efficiently, it also works to protect the ice maker from lime scale buildup that can severely affect the quality of the unit. Another added benefit is that it can reduce bad taste and odors from the original tap water, making it easier to drink; removing chlorine, dust, rust, and other particles also ensure that the water stays clean and keeps you healthy and safe. Also, installation by a licensed plumber is strongly recommended. While it is well insulated, this ice maker is not a freezer. The drain line included with this maker is gravity-only. A condensate pump is needed for pumping the water to any location other than a close-by floor drain.","Up to 45 lbs. of ice production/day; 25 lbs. of ice storage; Insulated ice storage, Removable ice bin; Ice scoop included; Drain required, Computerized controls; For built-in or freestanding applications; Reversible door, Simple 3-step installation; Produces restaurant quality clear, hard, cubed ice, Ice comes out in sheets and will have to be broken apart; Dimensions: 32.8"" H x 14.6"" W x 23.6"" D",Koldfront,1303

Like a window fan, our premium window dryer vent is extremely easy to install and remove. Plus, it ships completely assembled and ready to go into your window - without any modifications! Just place the vent hood into an open window and adjust the side panels, closing your window the rest of the way. When you\re done, lift away the vent and slide your window shut. <br><br> No more crushed metal or cracked plastic, our window vents are built to last which means we use heavy duty 24-gauge galvanized steel. Stronger than aluminum and sturdier than plastic, our never-before-seen window vent can handle routine venting from a dryer, spray booth, laser engraving machine or virtually anything else with a 4 inch round exhaust. In addition the window dryer vent is extremely safe to use and passes all commercial and residential building codes in the USA. <br><br>Our enlarged exterior hood reduces airflow resistance, minimizing lint buildup for super-safe and efficient drying, while an aluminum back draft damper protects against outdoor drafts. Equipped with a single 4-inch round exhaust outlet designed for standard dryer vent duct, this adjustable window vent fits 18"" to 24"" inch wide windows.

Know if your food is at risk of being dangerous to eat or rotten without any need of wires, batteries, or power.

B01EGRGCNG,Coldpour Kegerator Tower Cooler,"Appliances, Refrigerators, Freezers and Ice Makers","The Coldpour Kegerator Tower Blower is the most cost effective way to eliminate foamy beer from a home kegerator! I am a professional draft beer technician. I install, service, and clean draft beer systems for a living. While working, the problem I see coming up time and time again in residential beer systems is a warm beer tower. When the beer inside the tower is allowed to get warm, all of the dissolved CO2 escapes from the beer as foam! This means that the first pour of the day is always a glass full of foam, and only after pouring a few beers does it finally start dispensing beer properly. This amount of waste is unacceptable in a commercial system, and it should be in your home too! When I started looking into a solution for this problem, I was extremely disappointed with what I found. All of the products were either too weak to properly cool a beer tower, or they were way overpriced. I decided there had to be a better system to cool a beer tower in a residential kegerator, and so the Coldpour was born! When designing the Coldpour, I extensively tested different types of fans and blowers, including those used by my competitors. In a commercial beer system, we always use squirrel-cage centrifugal type blowers as they deal with static pressure much better than an axial fan. I focused on this type of fan, and found a solution that is both powerful and very quiet. The Coldpour comes with a 3D printed faceplate, a 3D printed hose adapter, a hose, and a 12v dc power supply. This is the best kegerator blower on the market! It has the best fan at the best price and with the best warranty. Try the Coldpour today! If you are not 100% satisfied with it I will refund 100% of your money within 14 days! 90 day 100% covered warranty! I guarantee the Coldpour will solve your foaming issues.","Eliminates foamy draft beer, Powerful fan blows cold air from the kegerator into the tower ensuring that your beer is cold all the way to the tap, Very quiet, hardly audible with kegerator door closed, Comes with hose and power supply, 3d printed face plate and hose adapter",Coldpour,5054

B01EMC06X2,GAP CAP - Dual Space-Saving Air Gap Drain For 1 1/2&quot; &amp; 2&quot; Standpipes,,"<strong>Air Gap International</strong> air gaps are easy to install, can share the standpipe, as well as provide back flow and back siphonage protection. They provide more than twice the code required minimum air gap opening.<br><br> <strong>Key Consideration:</strong> Water Softener air gaps generally are installed near the laundry facilities in the garage, basement or in the laundry room for convenient access to the house drainage piping and secondly, there almost never exists a dedicated (unused) standpipe just waiting to be used by the instaler for surmounting their drain line air gap. Thus the critical feature of the air gap is its ability to share a standpipe with the washing machine drain hose.<br> <br> Properly designed and installed, air gaps, like check valves, allow water to flow only in the desired direction. The key characteristics for an air gap is protection from back flow and back siphonage. <br><br> All units are dual listed by NSF and UPC. Dual listing conveys generally this important message: countrywide as well as international acceptance.","Ideal space-saving air gap, Twin inlet port: Larger port is 1/2"" slip that also directly accommodates 5/8"" O.D. poly tubing. Smaller RO port directly accepts 3/8"" O.D.poly tubing., Includes inlet elbow with flow straightener (P/N 8504)., 5 to 7 G.P.M., Fits 1 1/2"" and 2"" standpipes.",Air Gap International,4108
B01EMHBTI8,"Amerigap T52 RO kit, Extra Long Thread Air Gap with Twin Inlet Ports for Dishwasher and Reverse Osmosis - Chrome","Appliances, Parts and Accessories, Dishwasher Parts and Accessories","Dishwasher air gap is a critical component in maintaining a safe portable water supply. It prevents any contaminants in the sink from flowing into the potable water system by siphonage and is the least expensive form of back-flow prevention. The last thing anyone wants is to have a contaminated water flowing back into dishwasher. The Amerigap brand <strong>RO dishwasher air gap</strong> provides many advantages over other air gaps available on the market and also insures safety and piece of mind that your water supply is uncontaminated. These advantages include: <ul> <li>Long body thread to accommodate any kitchen counter-top thickness</li> <li>Super strong mounting nuts that will not strip during installation</li> <li>Tested and listed for compliance with applicable plumbing codes to ensure legal installation</li> <li>Dual ports to accommodate drainage flow from a dual dishwasher</li> <li>Extra large drain port to minimize clogging</li> <li>Legal to install in any state</li> </ul> <br> RO dishwasher air gap is listed by UPC and tested for compliance with IPC and NSF standards. A common misconception is that a ""high loop"" (routing a drain line above a sink\s flood level, for instance) and a wye connection will provide the same function as an air gap; this is not true, because the continuous connection between dishwasher and drain line still will allow back-flow through siphoning. To avoid portable water contamination (dirty water in your dishwasher) a dual dishwasher air gap must be installed for dual dishwashers drainage lines.","Designed to insure a legal air gap for a dishwasher and RO (reverse osmosis) filter, Eliminates the need for an RO air gap faucet (cuts down on gurgling sound), Provides extra long thread for mounting through a thick counter-top, Solid brass caps to match your faucet are available separately, UPC listed to guarantee safety and tested for compliance to IPC and NSF standard",Air Gap International,2370
