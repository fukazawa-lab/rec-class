Dental Fresh makes that incredibly easy. <br /> <br /> Our clinically-proven water additive features a unique self-regulating formula that activates, releases and destroys bad breath causing germs and bacteria microorganisms only when exposed to bacteria, periodontal pathogens, and acidic areas where plaque has formed. The more andldquo;issuesandrdquo; present, the stronger the formula works for your cat. And, in turn, the less andldquo;issuesandrdquo; present, the less the formula targets those areas. All of the cats (and dogs!) in your household can safely drink from the same water bowl because each pet will receive a different dosage of the active ingredient, depending on their individual dental needs. And unlike many water bowl additives on the market, Dental Fresh contains no alcohol, no sugar, no surfactants or detergents, and no pungent mint flavors. It does not cause staining, has no taste or artificial flavorings, and can be safely used long-term. Dental Fresh Original Formula for Cats is available in an 8-fluid ounce bottle.<br /> <br /> We know that your cats are more than just pets - they are part of the family - so Dental Fresh designs premium oral health products that pet parents can actually afford. Your cat will have fresher breath, whiter teeth, and healthier gums and you will feel confident knowing that you are being proactive with your catandrsquo;s oral health andndash; making you both happy and able to focus on more important things like naps, games and snuggles.","TOOTHBRUSH IN A BOTTLE  Dental Fresh Original Formula is the worlds first and only clinically proven toothbrush in a bottle for cats.

The purpose of mechanical filtration is to trap and accumulate debris and waste material coming from the pond. The purpose of biological filtration is to convert toxic by-products of fish metabolism and other organic waste into much less harmful substances. The purpose of UV-C filtration is to inhibit single-celled algae growth. <div class=""centerImage""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/PetSafe/LagunaPressureFloDetails._SL500_.jpg"" alt=""Laguna Pressure-Flo"" height=""201"" width=""500""></div> All ponds will benefit from the addition of a filtration system. A good filtration system, such as the Laguna Pressure Flo ensures that the water quality of the pond will remain clear of impurities which can accumulate and create a cloudy or toxic environment for pond plants and fish. The Laguna Pressure Flo will provide your fish with a clean and clear environment to live a healthy life in.</div> <div class=""half-col last""> <h4>How Pressure-Flo Filters Work</h4> Pressure-Flo filters are designed to provide three important water filtration operations that are essential for keeping pond water clear and healthy: mechanical and biological filtration, and UVC sterilization. The filters are designed to work in tandem with a solids handling pump. For best results, use a Laguna Max-Flo circulating pump. With the filter connected to the outlet of a pump, water enters the unit through the water inlet. It is then forced to pass through the mechanical filtration stage, consisting of foam filters that intercept and trap dirt and debris. Next, water reaches the biological filtration* chamber where it comes into contact with beneficial bacteria. Finally, dirt-free water passes along the UV-C lamp unit, where it is exposed to ultraviolet rays that inhibit algae growth and green water. Water then returns to the pond through the outlet.<br><br><b>Backwash-Cleaning System</b><br> During operation, coarse debris is captured at the surface of the foam filters.

The purpose of mechanical filtration is to trap and accumulate debris and waste material coming from the pond. The purpose of biological filtration is to convert toxic by-products of fish metabolism and other organic waste into much less harmful substances. The purpose of UV-C filtration is to inhibit single-celled algae growth. <div class=""centerImage""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/PetSafe/LagunaPressureFloDetails._SL500_.jpg"" alt=""Laguna Pressure-Flo"" height=""201"" width=""500""></div> All ponds will benefit from the addition of a filtration system. A good filtration system, such as the Laguna Pressure Flo ensures that the water quality of the pond will remain clear of impurities which can accumulate and create a cloudy or toxic environment for pond plants and fish. The Laguna Pressure Flo will provide your fish with a clean and clear environment to live a healthy life in.</div> <div class=""half-col last""> <h4>How Pressure-Flo Filters Work</h4> Pressure-Flo filters are designed to provide three important water filtration operations that are essential for keeping pond water clear and healthy: mechanical and biological filtration, and UVC sterilization. The filters are designed to work in tandem with a solids handling pump. For best results, use a Laguna Max-Flo circulating pump. With the filter connected to the outlet of a pump, water enters the unit through the water inlet. It is then forced to pass through the mechanical filtration stage, consisting of foam filters that intercept and trap dirt and debris. Next, water reaches the biological filtration* chamber where it comes into contact with beneficial bacteria. Finally, dirt-free water passes along the UV-C lamp unit, where it is exposed to ultraviolet rays that inhibit algae growth and green water. Water then returns to the pond through the outlet.<br><br><b>Backwash-Cleaning System</b><br> During operation, coarse debris is captured at the surface of the foam filters. As a result, sooner or later depending on pond conditions, the external surface of the foam filters will clog and hinder proper filtration, because of reduced water flow. The limited water flow through the foam filters reduces the effectiveness of both the biological and UV-C filtration. This condition can easily be detected thanks to the cleaning indicator on top of the filter unit.<br><br><div class=""rightImage""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/PetSafe/LagunaPressureFloKeepHandsClean._SL300_.jpg"" alt=""Laguna Pressure-Flo"" height=""300"" width=""222""></div> Pressure-Flo filters feature a unique Backwash-Cleaning System that completely cleans the entire surface of the mechanical foam filters without opening the filter or shutting off the pondandrsquo;s pump.

DC 50 features top mounted GPS and GLONASS receivers and a newly-redesigned steel VHF antenna. Switching to rescue mode reduces the refresh rate in order to preserve battery life, giving you more time to look for a lost dog. Plus, Collar Lock creates a 4-digit PIN number that helps prevent others from seeing your dogandrsquo;s whereabouts andmdash; a useful feature in field trials to ensure that an Astro is used only as a recovery tool when a dog in competition becomes lost., Bark Detection lets you know your dog is barking even if itandrsquo;s out of audible range, a crucial feature for treeing hounds or running hounds that cover a lot of ground, even in heavy cover., The intuitive and easy-to-use Astro system takes dog tracking to an entirely new level with new software for the 320 which supports the DC 50 dog device and adds new features, such as bark detection. The interface streamlines what is displayed by allowing dogs that are outside the current zoom level to have their location notated in the displayandrsquo;s margin. You can also choose the amount of each dogandrsquo;s tracklog displayed, or toggle it off completely, to avoid cluttering the map., The Astro 320, compatible with any DC-series transmitter, also has enhanced map drawing capabilities, BirdsEye Satellite Imagery compatibility (subscription required), vibration-based alerts and a 3-axis electronic compass., Both durable and waterproof, the Astro 320 system features the legendary toughness thatandrsquo;s built to withstand the elements, whether itandrsquo;s dust, dirt, humidity or water. Nothing is a match for this essential hunting companion., Getting what you need for the hunt is now a little easier. You can purchase the entire Astro bundle or as many DC 50 collars as you need. And your 320 is compatible with every DC series dog collar. The DC 50 is our only dog device with remote bark detection and improved battery life (including battery preserving rescue mode). The improved battery life means when you set your update rate to every 5 seconds the battery lasts 26 hours. In rescue mode, the battery lasts 54 hours, giving you more time to find your lost dog., Astro 320 has a microSDandtrade; card slot so you can load TOPO U.S. 24K maps for land elevation contours or City Navigator NTandreg; map data for turn-by-turn routing on roads. Astro 320 also supports BirdsEye Satellite Imagery (subscription required), that so you can download satellite images to your device and integrate them with your maps. Mapping depicts important nearby geographical features and lets you know if your dog has crossed a creek or is nearing a dangerous road., Astro 320 is also compatible with Garmin Custom Maps, free software that transforms paper and electronic maps into downloadable maps for your device., As often as every 5 seconds, your dogandrsquo;s DC 50 transmits his position to your handheld, and you can see his current location and a trail of where heandrsquo;s been on the map page of your handheld. Switch over to the Dog Tracker page to view a compass pointing to your dogandrsquo;s location as well as his current status: whether heandrsquo;s running, sitting, on point or treeing quarry. Astro also can let you know when your dog is barking, even if heandrsquo;s out of audible range., You can also see each dogandrsquo;s precise distance on the map page, and you can choose to auto zoom the map so all dogs can be seen on the display at any time. Dogs that are too far away to fit on the mapandrsquo;s current zoom scale can be notated on the displayandrsquo;s margin in the direction of the dogandrsquo;s location. You can also choose the duration that each dogandrsquo;s tracklog is viewed on the display, or toggle it off completely., Astro boasts a high-sensitivity GPS and GLONASS receiver which is mounted to the top of the collar so that can track your dogandrsquo;s position even in heavy tree cover or deep canyons. You can track up to 10 dogs at one time with Astro, from up to 9 miles away (depending on terrain). The system transmits information by line-of-sight, so it reaches farthest in flat, open territory., After youandrsquo;ve captured your quarry, mark the exact spot with Astroandrsquo;s Covey Counterandtrade;, a special waypoint that tells you the exact location, time of day and elevation where you found your prey, as well as the number of birds you flushed and took from that location. Astro lets you save other special waypoints, such as andldquo;Truckandrdquo; and andldquo;Lodge,andrdquo; so you can save the location of these places quickly and easily for each hunt. Astro also offers special waypoint icons to represent food plots, tree stands and other hunting-related points., Take charge of your next adventure with BaseCamp, software that lets you view and organize maps, waypoints, routes, and tracks. This free trip-planning software even allows you to create Garmin Adventures that you can share with friends, family or fellow explorers.

It uses accelerometer-based bark identification to distinguish between barking and other vocalizations., ""Its compact and lightweight, and includes a user-replaceable CR2 battery (up to 10 months battery life). Even with integrated stainless steel contact points andmdash; optimized to work on all dog breeds and coat thicknesses andmdash; BarkLimiter is still one of the most compact designs on the market. And its ready to go right out of the box andmdash; no set-up required."", The BarkLimiter detects bark signals solely through vibrations from a dogandrsquo;s throat. This virtually eliminates false corrections caused by scratching or scraping of surfaces, or other noises like the barks of nearby dogs (as in a kennel situation). In addition, BarkLimiter has been designed to recognize qualitative differences in barking. It corrects for obsessive or nuisance barking and ignores andldquo;goodandrdquo; barking. This allows the dog to communicate injury or threat without activating the device., BarkLimiter is automatically set for Autorise right out of the box.

FELIWAY products are a clinically proven, drug-free solution to help alleviate many of the unwanted behaviors cat owners deal with. FELIWAY MultiCat sends harmony messages to cats and restores harmony between cats living together.

Cat owners saw a 70% reduction in conflict in 3 weeks. Use FELIWAY MultiCat Starter Kit if you have 2 or more cats living together and if they show signs of tension like chasing, blocking, staring. Use the diffuser in the rooms where your cats spends the most time. Plug the diffuser in an electric socket with a minimum clear distance above the diffuser of 5 ft. (The oily vapor carrying the FELIWAY messages rises in a column of warm air above the diffuser). One diffuser covers up to 700 sq. ft. You may need to use more than one diffuser for a large or multi-floor home. Be sure to replace your diffuser every 6 months and refill vials every 4 weeks.

The variation depends on the ambient temperature, humidity and air flow present in the house or where the diffuser is placed. 3) All pets respond to pheromones, but the degree to which they respond is determined by many factors. How severe is the stress the cat is experiencing currently (it is easier to prevent than treat), has there been any positive changes to the environment (adding extra resources like litter boxes and food bowl), what are the cats previous experiences (if one cat had a bad experience with a housemate they may have learned not to trust other cats).""","#1 brand used and recommended by veterinarians, Clinically proven to work.
