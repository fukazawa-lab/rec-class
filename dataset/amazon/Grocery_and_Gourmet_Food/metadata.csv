Originating from China, it is one of the most popular types of bonsai trees and is a firm favorite of many bonsai enthusiasts. The Juniper is a low growing plant, producing lush greenery and small, firm, silvery blue berries atop interesting bark that adapts well to several creative forms of Bonsai bark manipulation. This type of tree offers the choice of being able to grow it indoors or outdoors. Its compact foliage makes it one of the best candidates to become a Bonsai. Junipers grow slowly and are very long-lived.

Some bonsai defoliate (drop leaves) when their environment changes. If upon the tree's arrival some leaves have dropped or turned slightly brown that does not mean the bonsai is unhealthy. Defoliation is the natural result of being in the low-light environment of a shipping box. Whenever possible, Brussels Bonsai avoids using Styrofoam-popcorn packaging. In some cases, Styrofoam popcorn must be used to safely pack unusually shaped bonsai. Organic popcorn packaging made from corn starch reacts with moisture from the trees and can dissolve. When you receive your tree, place the box in a shaded area to unpack. Inspect tree for damage to branches or leaves. Water soil if dry. Place each bonsai in protected shade for at least one week before moving to a sunny location."", '<b>What is a Bonsai?</b><br> Literally, the Japanese word ""bonsai"" means ""tray tree"" or ""plant grown in a pot."" The term refers to the artistic techniques used to capture the natural beauty of trees, rather than a specific variety of tree. A full-grown tree and a bonsai can be grown from the same seed--the bonsai has simply been dwarfed and shaped through years of training. To develop authentic bonsai, Brussels grows specimens under carefully controlled conditions, meticulously training each tree with wire and pruning over a period of years. The value of a particular bonsai typically depends on size, age, and training. Generally, more expensive trees are larger, older, and have had more detailed, elaborate training. These qualities combined create the illusion of a large tree in a natural setting.', '<b>Deciduous/Outdoor Bonsai Care</b>', '<b><i>Climate</i></b><br> Outdoor bonsai are deciduous trees that require the same climate changes in spring, summer, fall, and winter as full-sized trees of the same species. As a rule, deciduous bonsai do well in regions with humidity levels of 50% to 75% and yearly temperature ranges of 20 to 100 degree F. During winter, deciduous bonsai must remain outdoors. This period of dormancy is essential--without it, the tree may become unhealthy and susceptible to disease. Protect or ""heel-in"" your bonsai by covering the pot and soil with pine needles or mulch. Place the tree against a wall to shield it from extreme winds. Outdoor bonsai are more vulnerable to extreme cold than full-size trees and should be moved to a garage, shed, cold frame, or basement when temperatures fall below 20 degrees F.', '<table> <table width=""0%"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""7"" align=""left""> <tr> <td> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/outdoorliving/display6sm.jpg""> </td> </tr> </table> <b><i>Placement</i></b><br> Deciduous bonsai need to be kept outdoors year-round. Natural sunlight and rainwater are both important elements in an ideal growing environment. Typically, they require six or more hours of direct sunlight a day and do well in locations that get shade from late afternoon sun. Outdoor bonsai may be displayed indoors once a month, for short periods of time (2-3 days). In Japan, bonsai are traditionally displayed against a solid black, white, wood, or bamboo background, or on a stand or pot larger than the tree. Stark contrasts enhance the bonsais simple beauty.', '<table> <table width=""0%"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""7"" align=""right""> <tr> <td> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/outdoorliving/water2.jpg""> </td> </tr> </table> <b><i>Watering</i></b><br> Generally speaking, water when the top of the soil is dry. Use a can or hose attachment that casts a soft, rain-like spray that wont disturb the soil in the pot. Do not allow bonsai to dry out. Water daily during hot summer months. In winter, though trees need less water, its a good idea to water well before a hard freeze (frozen water acts as insulation).', '<b><i>Soil and fertilizer</i></b><br> Bonsai trees spend years in the same soil and eventually deplete the available nutrients.

After receiving your tree, wait at least one growing season before repotting. Using proper bonsai soil is critical. Brussels bonsai soil consists of a mixture of high-fired clay particles and finely ground pine bark. The soil-free mix does not compact, allows water to drain easily, and helps prevent the root rot that often occurs with ordinary potting soil.', 'It is important to pot your bonsai correctly. Prepare your container for potting by putting screen over the drain holes. Run wire through the drain screen--you will need this to secure the tree in the container. Trim the rootball so it will fit in the bonsai pot. Keep in mind, cutting larger roots is better than cutting small feeder roots. Continue trimming the root ball until it will fit into the bonsai container. Be sure to place a good layer of bonsai soil on the bottom of the bonsai container.', 'Place the tree in the pot. Use the wire to secure the tree in the bonsai container. Twist and pull the wire with pliers to tighten. Add bonsai soil around the root ball.

Regular pruning produces smaller branches. A simple pair of pointed-nose scissors does the job. Wiring may also be used to hold them in a desired position or location. If youre happy with the branch placement as is, there is no real need to wire. For detailed instruction in the art of pruning bonsai, Brussels Bonsai recommends purchasing a book on basic training techniques.', 'If you choose to wire your bonsai, make sure to use heavier gauge wire for larger branches on the bottom of the tree, and lighter gauge for smaller branches. Begin by sticking the end of the wire into the soil next to the trunk of the tree. Wrap the wire around the trunk until you come to the first branch. Continue curling the wire around the branch. Once you have come to the end of a branch, cut and remove the excess wire.

Humidity domes and year round warm weather are not necessary. Don't be fooled by other offers for Venus Flytraps that have them arrive in or with terrariums or humidity domes. These type of plants have strong light requirements and it is a myth that they need high humidity. The truth is that Venus Flytrap setups with terrariums or humidity domes almost always cause these types of plants to eventually die. They need to be grown in open air with containers that allow air to get into their soil and there should be little to block or diffuse their lighting. Venus Flytraps take about 2-3 years from seed to reach a decent size. A kit with Venus Flytrap seeds is not going to quickly turn into a Venus Flytrap about the size of the one offered in this listing.

It is also known as Philodendron bipinnatifidum, and is native to Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, and Paraguay in South America. This tall growing, shrub-like tropical plant has unique, green foliage with large growing, uniquely shaped leaves! With age, the leaves take on a deep-lobed pattern. Being a standard Philodendron, it appreciates moderate lighting and has moderate to heavy watering needs but tends to be quite forgiving on both ends of the spectrum. While the original Philodendron selloum can grow quite large outdoors (around 15 feet tall and 15 feet wide), this 'Hope' hybridized version only grows to be around 4' tall and 3' wide, making it much more manageable. Philodendrons are one of the most popular house plants due to their attractive foliage and ease of care. This plant is pretty versatile at different life stages, but can last very long-term as an attractive house plant. It prefers evenly, almost constantly moist soil, but needs drainage and will not do well in a soggy environment. The leaves of this plant are significantly more toxic than the standard Philodendron if ingested, and is therefore not recommended to a household with pets that tend to chew on leaves.

Himalayan salt is rich in trace minerals, which adds to the depth of flavor your foods will achieve when cooked, chilled, or simply presented on the plate. Himalayan salt plates have naturally high moisture contents, which allow the plate to be heated or chilled to extreme temperatures. The Charcoal Companion Himalayan Salt Plate / 8"" x 8"" x 1.5"" is a block of history many years in the making. The plate comes from an enormous pink salt boulder, harvested from ancient salt mines in the far reaches of the Himalayas. That salt boulder was crafted into individual blocks or plates. How to care for your salt plate: Himalayan salt is naturally antimicrobial and requires no cleansers. After use, simply wash the salt plate under warm water and scrub lightly with a soft brush or sponge. Do not submerge the plate in water. Dry with a paper towel to remove any excess pockets of water in the plate. Air-dry the plate for at least 24 hours before next use. Store salt plate in a dry environment until next use. Your salt plate\'s life: Part of the charm of a Himalayan Salt Plate is the naturally occurring irregularities and fissures in the surface of the salt, none of which affect the cooking properties of the mineral. The color and form of each salt plate is unique and will change when heated. With use, the plate may develop more surface depressions and will eventually dissolve completely. Proper care of the salt plate will extend its useful life. Caution: The Himalayan Salt Plate will be very hot during and immediately following cooking. Use a heat resistant glove when handling. Please note: We do not recommend using in the oven.']","['100% Himalayan Salt Imparts Naturally Rich, Salty Flavor', 'Heat and Use as a Cooking Surface or Chill to Keep Food Cool', 'Great for Presentation, Use on Grill or Gas Range, or In Refrigerator', 'Salt Plate Measures 8"" by 8"" by 1.5""', '100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEED.

They are all genetically identical. Your B52 comes with a 3 inch net pot, moss appropriate for carnivorous plant soil loosely packed, and a full page detailed care sheet, written by an experienced Venus Flytrap grower specifically designed for beginners, explaining how to take care of Venus Flytraps. All you will need is a bowl or saucer to hold the Venus Flytrap's pot that it comes with and a little bit of water, a gallon or so of reverse osmosis or distilled water, and a sunny window or a place in the yard to put your Venus Flytrap's pot in. Humidity domes and year round warm weather are not necessary. Don't be fooled by other offers for Venus Flytraps that have them arrive in or with terrariums or humidity domes. These type of plants have strong light requirements and it is a myth that they need high humidity. The truth is that Venus Flytrap setups with terrariums or humidity domes almost always cause these types of plants to eventually die. They need to be grown in open air with containers that allow air to get into their soil and there should be little to block or diffuse their lighting. Venus Flytraps take about 2-3 years from seed to reach a decent size. A kit with Venus Flytrap seeds is not going to quickly turn into a Venus Flytrap about the size of the one offered in this listing.

She asked her dad to make some symbol of the love between her and the her groom that everyone could see. After several attempts and carefully deliberation the baker finally came up with an idea. He secretly place two figurines on top of the wedding cake. One of them symbolized his daughter and the other her future husband. The baker felt this was the perfect symbol of their love and their unity. On the wedding day the daughter was so excited to see the cake and she was overjoyed with the beautiful gift her father had given her. The figurines stood in the center of the cake and at the center of the wedding. This showed the importance of the love between the couple! It is not exactly known if this is a true story or not but it is a fun story at least and one that shows the significance of the wedding cake topper.

The breeding is Vanda Kasem's Delight x Vanda Madame Rattana. Some come out a purple / violet, but this is a mericlone of the 'Blue' cultivar, so we expect it to flower as blue. These have reached blooming size and could throw a spike anytime now. The roots are 2 to 3 feet long and the leaves are 7 to 10 inches or more. These are very tropical, so do keep them warm in the winter. Grow in dappled sunlight and remember to water daily. They are a little more work, but you get a lot of reward when they flower. They can have 5 to 7 flowers on a spike. Use a liquid fertilizer. You get one like the plants pictured. You can buy with confidence. We guarantee customer satisfaction upon delivery.""]","['Makes lovely blue flowers', 'Blooming size, but NOT in flower now', 'Water daily for best results']",The Orchid Gallery,370
