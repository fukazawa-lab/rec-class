It comes with all the nuts and bolts youll need for installation."", <strong>About Everlast</strong><br> The name Everlast is synonymous with boxing. Renown internationally as a manufacturer of boxing equipment, Everlast started out as a swimwear manufacturer in 1910. Headquartered in the Bronx, NY, the company was founded by 17-year-old Jacob Golomb. The son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, Jacob Golomb was dissatisfied with the durability of swimsuits because they barely lasted a season, so he began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year. He proudly gave them the name, <i>Everlast</i>. Although the swimsuits did not last through the years, the name did., Over the next years, Golomb expanded his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment. In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Everlast. Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more than 15 rounds of intensive boxing training. Golomb specially designed the training gear for Dempsey. In 1919, Dempsey won the worlds heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb. Everlast became the headquarters for boxing equipment throughout the world. In 1925, Golomb designed elastic-waist trunks to replace the leather-belted trunks then worn by boxers. These trunks, now known as boxer trunks, immediately became famous. Jacob Golomb ran the business until he passed away in the early 1950s and his son, Dan, took over. In 1958, Ben Nadorf joined Everlast and purchased 50% of the company from the Golomb family. When Dan Golomb passed away in 1995, Nadorf purchased the familys remaining 50% interest. Nadorf remained the President and Principle Share Holder of Everlast until October 24, 2000., Everlast mens and womens apparel and accessories continue today to be tremendously successful both inside and outside the ring. In addition, Everlast boxing trunks and equipment remain the proud and undefeated champion of the boxing industry for more than 90 years. The history continues, as the name states. Everlast has a traditional past and a knockout future., ""<strong>Whats in the Box?</strong><br> Training bag holder, hardware"", <strong>Manufacturer Warranty</strong><br> 1 year, ","Use as a mount point for single or double-end heavy bags, Durable enamel powder coating, Can be bolted to wooden floors or ceilings, ""Includes all the nuts and bolts youll need for installation"", ""Everlast warrants its products to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of 120 days from date of purchase, provided they have not been subjected to obvious abuse, neglect or misuse.

Government cutbacks led Allen, a Harvard-trained physicist, to transform his garage hobby into a new industry. A cycling enthusiast, inventor, and family man, Allen had a personal need for a bike-carrying device. On weekends, he would take his sons and wife to Cape Cod or the White Mountains of New Hampshire. What proved difficult time and again was the transport of his familys bicycles. Rather than fight through inconvenience with twine and a dinged car, Allen sought an answer for himself as well as a market in which he foresaw major growth possibilities."", ""Always a pathfinder, Allen took to work in his Lincoln, Massachusetts, garage in search of a more efficient way to transport bikes. Drafting designs during the day and constructing them throughout the night, he put together a model made of electrical conduit, metal strapping, and fire hose casings (for padding). At first, the Allens tested the prototype on weekend excursions. Finding the first trunk-mounted rack to be a success, Dick started Allen Bike Racks. Dealer acceptance came quickly, and by 1971 Allen Bike Racks were sold nationally through a number of major bicycle distributors. Today, the company owns more than three dozen patents and offers a versatile product line of bike racks while Dicks son Alex now owns and operates the business. What started out as a small garage run operation now operates three warehouses nationally, two factories abroad, and has products sold in more than a dozen countries around the world."", , Allen Sports is dedicated to making our products simple, so you can spend more time enjoying them.

B0038QYRDO,Celestron 52268 C90 Mak Spotting scope (Black),"Sports and Outdoors, Sports and Fitness, Hunting and Fishing, Shooting, Optics, Spotting Scopes","The Maksutov optical design is recognized for being a portable design that is easy to use and has a variety of applications, making it an excellent choice for both terrestrial and astronomical usage. This C90 Mak has excellent optics with razor sharp images over a wide field., Celestronandrsquo;s 52268 90mm Maksutov Spotting Scope delivers excellent high power optics in a compact, affordable package. The 52268 package includes a backpack style soft carrying case, an 8x21 erect image finder scope, a 1.25 inch size correct image 45* prism diagonal, and a fully coated 32mm plossl eyepiece for a magnification of 39X., The Maksutov-Cassegrain design of the C90 uses a combination of mirrors and lenses; this andldquo;foldedandrdquo; optical system has a focal length of 1250mm in a body only twelve inches long. The Maksutov design delivers high power views without a trace of the chromatic aberration, also called blue fringing, that can distort high power views in competing refractor style spotting scopes. At 40X magnification where some low cost spotting scopes start to seem fuzzy, the C90 is just getting started. The C90 uses the same 1.25 inch eyepieces used in astronomical telescopes. The standard equipment 32mm plossl eyepiece yields a magnification of 39X, but many other eyepieces can be used to vary the magnification., The Celestron model 52268 seems very well built, with excellent multi-coatings visible on the front lens. The real beauty of this 90mm Maksutov spotting scope, however, is in the view it offers. When I use an optional 12.5mm eyepiece to look at Jupiter at 100X I can clearly see Jupiterandrsquo;s major cloud bands as well as its four moons. When I look at the Moon and stars I can easily push the magnification to 200X with an optional 6mm eyepiece. When I look at birds in the backyard, Iandrsquo;m treated to delightful views full of vibrant color and crisp detail. With a close focus distance of only 15 feet, the detail and texture I see is simply amazing., High magnification viewing requires a solid tripod, of course. Celestronandrsquo;s <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007UQNY0/${0}""> Heavy Duty Altazimuth Tripod </a> comes with slow motion controls to allow the scope to be pointed precisely, and I can clamp the dovetail base on my CG5 mount for astronomical use. The other drawback to high magnification viewing is a narrow field of view; high magnification makes it hard to follow moving targets like birds in flight. Overall the Celestron C90 Maksutov Spotting Scope does a fine job as a companion to good pair of binoculars. The C90 also doubles as a portable astronomy scope; it wonandrsquo;t show the flag on the Moon but it will show thousands of craters on the Moon as well as showing the moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn. --<I>Jeff Phillips</I>, <B>Pros:</B> <ul> <li>Compact and portable <li>Excellent high power optics <li>Upgradeable with 1.25andrdquo; eyepieces <li>Adaptable for astronomy and photography </ul> <B>Cons:</B> <ul> <li>Not waterproof </ul>","Multi Coated Optics, Maksutov-Cassegrain Optical Design, Compact and Portable Design, Erect Image System for Terrestrial and Astronomical Use, Built-in T-Adapter threads for Ease of Adapting SLR Cameras, Comes with 32 mm Eyepiece, 45 Erect Image Diagonal and 8x21 Erect Image Finderscope, Backpack Made of Nylon",Celestron,5007

The new ACULON Rangefinder delivers world-class performance in an extremely compact body. Nowhere else will you find the speed, the precision and the optical quality of the palm-sized ACULON., If smaller means better, then the ACULON Rangefinder is at the top of its class. With its ultra-compact size (3.6x2.9x1.5), this new rangefinder redefines portability and is small enough to rival most smartphones. Its palm-sized dimensions make it comfortable to wear around your neck or fit in your pocket. And because it weighs just 4.4 ounces (without batteries), the ACULON Rangefinder is so light youll hardly even notice its there., Operating the ACULON Rangefinder is intuitive and requires just the simple push of a button to get an instant distance reading. When the button is held down, the rangefinder gives a continuous measurement for up to 20 seconds as you scroll across the visible area. The display is uncluttered and free of any unnecessary obstructions so you can concentrate on the object youre ranging. The ACULON Rangefinder automatically powers down after eight seconds of inactivity., The ACULON Rangefinder is programmed in Distant Target Priority Mode  meaning that it will display the range of the furthest target amongst a group of targets measured. This is particularly useful if the object being measured is partially obscured by grass or brush., The ACULON Rangefinder has 6x magnification and a 20mm objective lens. It features long eye relief (16.7 mm) and is engineered using Nikons multilayer coated optics, which provide an even higher light transmittance across the entire visible light spectrum. This minimizes the loss of light due to reflection, thereby ensuring a more natural, clearer view., Speed is a virtue in which the ACULON Rangefinder excels. As soon as you push the button, it delivers an accurate reading from six yards all the way out to 550 yards. Measurements are easy to read and are displayed in 1 yard/meter increments.

For best results, we recommend changing your filter after 2 months or when its filtered 40 gallons/150 liters. To clean the bottle, remove the filter and hand wash with warm, soapy water. <br />, About bobble: Founded in 2010, we set out to satisfy our desire for fresh, tasty and portable water while keeping our wallets and planet happy. Disposable water wont do that, so we decided to reinvent the water bottle. No problem! We needed our bottle to be reusable and resilient. We refused to sacrifice style in favor of function. We wanted water that tasted better. We wanted it all, and we wanted it now. And so, bobble was born. Since then the bobble family has expanded to bring you coffee, tea, and at-home products - all created with the idea that taste will always triumph over waste.<br /> At bobble, our mission is threefold. 1  to bring style to everyday life, 2  to encourage health and fitness and 3) sustainability  we provide sleek, easy and impactful drinking solutions that help reduce single serve waste.","Reusable water bottle with replaceable carbon filter, Replaceable carbon filter removes the taste and odor of chlorine from municipal tap water, Replaceable carbon filter is equal to 300 single-serve 16.9-ounce water bottles, BPA-free plastic bottle with soft touch carry cap, 18.5 fl oz./550 mL, Made in the USA",Bobble,6926

B0195MZHBK,"Blackstone Table Top Grill - 17 Inch Portable Gas Griddle - Propane Fueled - For Outdoor Cooking While Camping, Tailgating or Picnicking","Sports and Outdoors, Outdoor Recreation, Camping and Hiking, Camp Kitchen, Stoves and Grills, Camping Grills","The Blackstone Table Top Grill/Griddle is the perfect stove to bring with you to any event or occasion. 260 square inches of cooking spaces allows you to cook multiple things at the same time! Hate doing dishes while camping? No worries with this griddle, simply wipe it off with a paper towel after use and be ready for the next meal! Its convenient size makes it easy to bring with you to the park, camping, hunting, or any get together. Easy to clean and remove grease tray keeps cook top clean. The H style burner provides even heat distribution for optimal cooking across the whole griddle. As outdoor enthusiasts and founders of BLACKSTONE we dreamed of a quality outdoor griddle and/or grill that could cook for large groups and families. In 2005 we made our vision a reality by creating BLACKSTONE PRODUCTS. We then launched the 36"" BLACKSTONE griddle that is still popular for backyard cooking and which brings families and friends together for fun and food. Our spectrum of gas griddles and gas grills are popular for backyard living, a BBQ, recreational cooking or commercial grade cooking. Since then, the company has expanded dramatically and created a brand new look as well as a large new line of durable rugged innovative and portable cooking innovations including an outdoor pizza oven and the ever so easy to transport and set-up DASH - and our products will last a lifetime. By using the latest technologies available and complementing them with our own innovations, we feel we have the leading edge on the market in our categories. Our products are designed and engineered in the USA by people who are avid users and live to entertain outside - at home, in the tailgater parking lot or just about anywhere. We pride ourselves on the quality of our products and how well they function while keeping the prices very affordable. We have assembled a strong and enthusiastic team with the utmost passion for BLACKSTONE and outdoor cooking including excellent engineers, intelligent industrial designers and uniquely creative graphic artists. We have the capability to make any adjustments to our current lines or create new units all together, tailored around your needs in a very short time in contrast to our larger entrenched old-school competitors. Look forward to future innovations from BLACKSTONE sooner than later. We are more than just another outdoor cooking appliance company that only focuses on the numbers and overlooks the end users by neglecting quality or deferring to accountants. We are here to stay and hope you enjoy BLACKSTONE products as much as we do.","CONVENIENT AND PORTABLE - This portable grill is built with an easy to use electric igniter, uses convenient 1 pound propane bottles for fuel, and has a built in grease catcher.
