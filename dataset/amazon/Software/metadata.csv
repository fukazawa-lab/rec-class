B001B010PC,Nikon Capture NX 2 Upgrade from Capture NX 1.x,"Software, Photography","Capture NX 2 Photo Editing Software Upgrade Version, ""Nikons Capture NX 2 software is a full-featured, nondestructive photo-editing program that gives photographers all the tools they need to quickly and easily edit their photographs. Also available in a full version, the upgrade software--which requires a valid serial number from v1.x--offers such editing features as color control points, selection control points, an auto-retouch brush, and shadow/highlight adjustment."", Enhancing the hue, brightness, and saturation of an image is as simple as placing a color control point on your image, then adjusting the length of the sliders. For example, color control points are a remarkably convenient way to change the color of flowers to look better against green surrounding foliage. As an alternative, editors can take a dull gray sky and add blue to change the mood of a captured scene. The selection control points, meanwhile, let you selectively edit photographs without manually outlining or masking the area for editing. Simply place a selection control point anywhere on the photograph, and then choose from almost any adjustment, including D-Lighting, Unsharp Mask, or Noise Reduction, while limiting the \reach"" of that adjustment to just the selected area., Capture NX 2 also adds an automatic retouch tool to its image editing toolbox, allowing users to seamlessly remove blemishes, dust, and other distracting elements from photographs while maintaining the integrity of the image. And thanks to the shadow/highlight adjustment, you can easily open up shadows or recover blown-out highlights. Highlight recovery is most effective for RAW (NEF) files; however, it will work with JPEG and TIFF files as well., ""The softwares redesigned v2 interface includes such features as customized workspaces, an improved toolbar function and layout, improved edit list functionality, a redesigned image browser with a favorites folder, and improved image resolution adjustments. The softwares holdover features from v1.x range include black/white/neutral control points, color management control, color aberration control, distortion control, a color booster, contrast/brightness adjustment, a saturation/warmth adjustment, black-and-white conversion, straighten and crop tools, and much more."", Finally, Capture NX 2 features award-winning U Point technology for precision selection and application of enhancements without complicated selections or layer masks. Designed to closely match the way photographers work with their images, Capture NX2 is easy to learn and creates the highest-quality results.

Posers new Weight Map Rigging provides a platform that will support third party figures that use Weight Mapping, by expanding the open, well documented and easily editable Poser PZ3 file format, to encourage creativity and user driven enhancements to Poser figures."", Need a way to move, scale or hide a bunch of objects in a Poser scene, at the same time? Now you can simply add any number of scene elements, from figures and props to lights, into a Grouping Object. They can be moved, rotated, scaled and animated or even hidden and revealed. Create multiple Grouping Objects to hold different areas of a scene, or related props and figures. Adding selected scene elements into any Grouping Object is easy using our powerful new Context Menu controls. This significant new feature will change how you manage your scenes, providing you plenty of control over whole groups of objects in that scene., ""Sometimes, its the simple things that make the biggest difference. Posers expanded Context Menus will vastly improve interaction and scene creation, and change the way you work with Poser forever. Six unique Context Menus have been developed for Figures, Actors, Objects, Lights, Cameras and Backgrounds to provide quick access to the most useful menu operations including selecting, toggling IK on/off, copying symmetry in poses, pointing lights, conforming clothing, setting parenting, changing light types, and even hiding/revealing all items in a Grouping Object. Once you start using Posers new Context Menus, youll enjoy working and playing with Poser all over again."", In the past, if you wanted to re-use a Poser scene with that perfect environment settings, lights, cameras, props and dependencies and even render settings, you had to build it, save it, then find and import it. With the new Scene Category in the Library you simply add that full Poser scene with lights, cameras, all props and figures in place, and with all dependencies right into the Library. From there your new scenes can be dragged directly from the Library into the Poser workspace. For Poser content developers this new feature will enable you to deliver fully constructed scenes with dependencies and optimal render settings that require less user support and are far easier to use., ""When we introduced Drag and Drop support in Posers Library, our users found it so much easier to apply materials, or conform clothing, or drop a pose right onto a figure. With the Librarys new Multi-select feature, youll be able to select several items of clothing and drag them right onto a figure and auto-conform them in one step. But it gets even better when working with multiple categories of items in your Favorites; Multi-select a hairstyle, several clothing items and a pose all at once, then click and drag them right onto your target figure. Poser will automatically apply the items. It doesnt get much easier. Within the Library, youll be able to drag and drop items from folder to folder making it easy to reorganize your Content."", If you own a Wacom pressure sensitive tablet, Poser is going to make you a very happy camper. We\ve engineered Wacom tablet support into the Morph Tool so you can have much finer control when creating morphs. Vary brush strength with pressure for any brush size you\ve set. The Morph Tool is powerful, but with tablet support, it\s gotten even better. The new \Flatten\ option for Morphing Tool Create mode moves points toward a ""best fit"" plane determined by the affected vertices., ""For our animators that have been looking for a way to animate a ball being throw or caught, weve introduced Constraint Channels and Objects. Basically, the Constraint Object is an animatable handle for an object that will allow you to parent it to a figures hand as it winds up for the throw, and then have the object leave the hand and fly through the air as if its being thrown. Constraints are a simple to use feature that will permit all kinds of cool animation effects."", We changed the face of rendering in Poser when we introduced Indirect Lighting (IDL). Poser users quickly discovered that, with high ambient values to cast light that with a few tweaks, they could open up a huge array of lighting effects. Now you can create Light Emitters; toggle off visibility in rendering for objects, yet still enable them to cast light. Build light domes, environment domes and large area lights to cast ambient light without being rendered in the scene. Combined with our new Poser Scene Library category, this feature will be a great way to deliver a fully lit IDL environment., ""In complex scenes it can be a little challenging to keep your camera focused on an area that youre working on using Posers original camera controls. To help out, weve introduced the Frame Selected Object Camera. With the click of a button, your current camera will zoom in on the selected object, allowing you take a closer look at exactly where youre working on. This makes it easier to navigate in and out of your deep scenes and saves you time when creating them."", Poser also includes a new mode as a companion feature to the new Frame Selected Object Camera. Simply toggle on the Orbit Selected mode and your current camera will rotate around the center point of the currently selected object. This makes it easier to focus on a selected element, and view it from every direction by spinning Camera trackball controls., ""Our engineers spent time under the hood to speed up Dynamic Hair. Now Posers powerful Dynamic Hair calculates collisions faster and renders it faster as well."", ""Weve heard your requests for faster pre-render texture handling and delivered two new methods that will save time the minute you press that Render Now button. Poser now preprocesses all scene textures in the background making use of your multicore processor, in prep for that first render, and can cache those textures session to session if you desire. Choose between traditional and the new Crisp texture filtering options."", Poser keeps improving and so does Python. We now provide Python 2.7 support to take full advantage of improvements to the scripting language., ""Poser 9 is now fully Cocoa based and supported on Apples latest OS X 10.7 Lion.   <h4>Why use Poser 9?</h4>  <h5>Creating 3D illustrations that include people or digital characters is time-consuming and hard.</h5>"", ""Designers and artists want to create art and animations with 3D characters, without having to create those 3D characters from scratch. We dont blame you! Thats why Poser and Poser Pro come with everything you need to quickly add life to your project."", Poser lets you focus on the story you want to tell by freeing you from having to build the actors and props in your story. Quickly customize and pose your characters on the stage, set up the scene with props, backgrounds and architectural elements to support that story and then create your final 3D art and animations., We changed the face of rendering in Poser when we introduced Indirect Lighting (IDL). And it became obvious when Poser users discovered that IDL enabled objects with high ambient values to cast light that with a few tweaks we could open up a huge array of lighting effects. Now you can create Light Emitters; toggle off visibility in rendering for objects, yet still enable them to cast light. Build light domes, environment domes and large area lights to cast ambient light without being rendered in the scene. Combined with our new Poser Scene Library category, this feature will be a great way to deliver a fully lit IDL environment., ""Poser 9s improved Firefly render engine now supports Indirect Lighting with Irradiance Caching for Global Illumination effects and even supports rendering with Ambient Occlusion. New Shader nodes enable Subsurface Scattering for luminescent skin tones and Custom Scattering for bioluminescent effects. Posers physically correct light fall-off produces more photo-real final renderings."", ""Skin, wax, and marble are just some of the materials that are translucent when struck by light. To recreate this subtle yet crucial effect when rendering these materials in Poser, weve incorporated a set of easy to configure Subsurface Scattering Material Nodes. New Nodes include Subsurface Skin, Custom Scatter, and basic Scatter. The Scatter Node includes a number of optimized pre-sets for Skin, Marble, Milk, Fruit and Vegetables. With Posers new Subsurface Material nodes, youll transform your scenes into rendered masterpieces with lifelike translucent surfaces."", Take crime scene recreation for example: you need an imaginary 3D world where you can place all the suspects, victims, weapons, explosions, and more and play out their interactions without anyone getting hurt. In fact, Poser Pro is a critical tool used by the production crew for the television drama Bones. They use it weekly to pose and animate their re-enactments--check out this video straight from one of their episodes., Industrial and architectural designers, medical illustrators, product engineers and graphic artists often need virtual humans to interact with a design, to convey a sense of scale or draw attention to a feature in a designed product. Poser lets you work with 3D actors in scenes that would be impossible to duplicate in the real world. Historic scenes, imaginary or fantasy scenes, sci-fi and superhero scenes are easy to create in Poser, so you can let your imagination run wild and build exactly the world you want, and populate that world with 3D characters., At your fingers tips is a huge library of included ready-to-pose and easy-to-customize characters with clothing and props that will fit into almost any scene you can imagine. Customize those figures with poses, expressions and face room morphs and set-up cameras and lights to support any perspective, point of view or lighting condition.","Get Started Fast - Drag and drop characters and props right onto Posers virtual stage to create 3D scenes, add lights and cameras, then render away!, Customize Characters - Start with one of the many included ready-to-pose 3D characters and customize them using your photos or hundreds of face shaping morphs to produce unique characters in minutes., Rendering Styles - Posers powerful rendering engine will transform any 3D scene youve created into photorealistic, cartoon or sketch style images and animations., Animate Easily - Posers key-frame animation tools make it easy to transition between poses, or make a character walk or talk, throw a ball or even dance., 3D Characters for Any Project - Create art or animation for graphic design, web, fine art and illustration projects.

Once you change the tempo, key or other effects with Pitch Switch you can easily save it to any popular sound format. You can export the key changed version of your favorite song on your iPhone, Android, or burn a practice CD with songs youve slowed down or transposed.","Vary pitch or tempo independently, Change the speed and pitch of any song, Works with most popular sound formats including MP3, WAV, CD and more, Built-in looping feature lets you focus on specific parts of a song, Perfect for practicing musicians",Inspyder Software Inc.,3178
