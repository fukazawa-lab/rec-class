B0000223UV,"Gorilla Original Gorilla Glue, Waterproof Polyurethane Glue, 8 ounce Bottle, Brown","Industrial and Scientific, Tapes, Adhesives and Sealants, Urethane Adhesives","The product that started it all. Original Gorilla Glue built a name for itself with its incredible, industrial holding power and versatility. The water activated polyurethane formula expands into materials to form an incredibly strong bond to virtually anything. Gorilla Glue is a 100% waterproof glue, safe for indoor and outdoor use and strong enough to stand up to the elements. Gorilla Glues your solution for almost any project or repair. Sand it, paint it, stain it. Simply stated, its the Toughest Glue on Planet Earth. Directions: 1.Prepare and Dampen the Surfaces: All surfaces must be clean, dust free and tight fitting. For shiny surfaces, such as metals, glass and some plastics, roughen up the material to give the glue something to bite into. Lightly dampen one surface with water. We recommend using a damp cloth or spraying with water. Do not saturate the surface. For dense hardwoods, lightly dampen both surfaces prior to gluing. 2. Evenly Apply Gorilla Glue Onto the Dry Surface. Carefully apply onto the dry surface. Do not over apply. We recommend wearing gloves or spreading the glue with a disposable brush. 3. Clamp the Two Surfaces Together Tightly. Make sure the clamping pressure is distributed evenly across the surface. Or, if you dont have a clamp, use heavy objects or Gorilla Tape to achieve the appropriate clamping pressure. Clamp objects for 12 hours. For best results, allow 24 hours to cure. 4. Clean up: If you need to remove any uncured squeeze out or wet glue, we recommend wiping with a dry cloth or using a standard paint thinner. Once the glue is dry, it is best removed mechanically: Try sanding, chiseling, scraping or picking. 5. Storage Tips: After each use, wipe the bottles lid and nozzle clean with a dry cloth. While still squeezing, tightly replace the cap and then store in a cool, dry place. You should expect a year shelf life.

Original Gorilla Glue built a name for itself with its incredible, industrial holding power and versatility. The water activated polyurethane formula expands into materials to form an incredibly strong bond to virtually anything. Gorilla Glue is a 100% waterproof glue, safe for indoor and outdoor use and strong enough to stand up to the elements. Gorilla Glues your solution for almost any project or repair. Sand it, paint it, stain it. Simply stated, its the Toughest Glue on Planet Earth. Directions: 1.Prepare and Dampen the Surfaces: All surfaces must be clean, dust free and tight fitting. For shiny surfaces, such as metals, glass and some plastics, roughen up the material to give the glue something to bite into. Lightly dampen one surface with water. We recommend using a damp cloth or spraying with water. Do not saturate the surface. For dense hardwoods, lightly dampen both surfaces prior to gluing. 2. Evenly Apply Gorilla Glue Onto the Dry Surface. Carefully apply onto the dry surface. Do not over apply. We recommend wearing gloves or spreading the glue with a disposable brush. 3. Clamp the Two Surfaces Together Tightly. Make sure the clamping pressure is distributed evenly across the surface. Or, if you dont have a clamp, use heavy objects or Gorilla Tape to achieve the appropriate clamping pressure. Clamp objects for 12 hours. For best results, allow 24 hours to cure. 4. Clean up: If you need to remove any uncured squeeze out or wet glue, we recommend wiping with a dry cloth or using a standard paint thinner. Once the glue is dry, it is best removed mechanically: Try sanding, chiseling, scraping or picking. 5. Storage Tips: After each use, wipe the bottles lid and nozzle clean with a dry cloth. While still squeezing, tightly replace the cap and then store in a cool, dry place. You should expect a year shelf life.

The water activated polyurethane formula expands into materials to form an incredibly strong bond to virtually anything. Gorilla Glue is a 100% waterproof glue, safe for indoor and outdoor use and strong enough to stand up to the elements. Gorilla Glues your solution for almost any project or repair. Sand it, paint it, stain it. Simply stated, its the Toughest Glue on Planet Earth. Directions: 1.Prepare and Dampen the Surfaces: All surfaces must be clean, dust free and tight fitting. For shiny surfaces, such as metals, glass and some plastics, roughen up the material to give the glue something to bite into. Lightly dampen one surface with water. We recommend using a damp cloth or spraying with water. Do not saturate the surface. For dense hardwoods, lightly dampen both surfaces prior to gluing. 2. Evenly Apply Gorilla Glue Onto the Dry Surface. Carefully apply onto the dry surface. Do not over apply. We recommend wearing gloves or spreading the glue with a disposable brush. 3. Clamp the Two Surfaces Together Tightly. Make sure the clamping pressure is distributed evenly across the surface. Or, if you dont have a clamp, use heavy objects or Gorilla Tape to achieve the appropriate clamping pressure. Clamp objects for 12 hours. For best results, allow 24 hours to cure. 4. Clean up: If you need to remove any uncured squeeze out or wet glue, we recommend wiping with a dry cloth or using a standard paint thinner. Once the glue is dry, it is best removed mechanically: Try sanding, chiseling, scraping or picking. 5. Storage Tips: After each use, wipe the bottles lid and nozzle clean with a dry cloth. While still squeezing, tightly replace the cap and then store in a cool, dry place. You should expect a year shelf life.

B000UV6ZPS,"CMS MAGNETICS 4&quot; x 6&quot; Green Magnetic Viewing Film, See Magnetic Field with this Magic Film to Learn Magnetism. Applicable for All Kinds of Magnets Including Neodymium Magnets, Lots of Fun!","Industrial and Scientific, Material Handling Products, Industrial Magnets, Rare Earth Magnets","This same film is used by professionals, like engineers, developers and researchers to find out the magnetic field distribution when a group of magnets are involved. It is also used in the fabrication industry to image the internal defect of a steel part combined with an X-Ray machine. Encased within the green film are millions of nano size magnet particles which can turn freely when close to a steel object or a permanent magnet. When the magnet particles change their orientations, the reflection rate to the light will also change so to show the magnetic field beneath it. This is why the film will change shades when a magnetic field is applied. The film turns darker when the magnetic field lines are perpendicular to the surface, and lighter when the field lines are horizontal, i.e., across the surface. If one pole is placed under it, it will show the magnet as a dark area with a lighter outline. If both poles are placed under the film, the areas close to the two poles are dark but the border of the two poles will show up as light line, so you can tell the pole orientations. Our pictures show the two same dimension magnets but magnetized differently. Also the film is highly flexible and can be easily wrapped around magnetic assemblies. Tips and uses: 1. Place the film close to the magnet to observe the pattern changes so you can identify how the magnet is magnetized and where the magnetic poles are on the magnet. 2. The stronger the magnets, the better the results. We recommend neodymium magnets instead of ceramic magnets. 3. To get the same results of our pictures, be sure to use the same type and same quantities of magnets. 4. The film will not identify north or south poles. Should you need a pole identifier, you can check out our pole detector listings. 5. Do not fold the film since it will leave a permanent wrinkle on it.","Green Micro-Encapsulated Film used to Show Magnetic Field, or Test Cracks on Steel Surfaces, Very Interesting to Actually See the Magnetic Field!

Applying an additional bead of thick ca along a seam and then curing it with insta-set significantly enhances a joints strength. For difficult to bond materials, insta-set can be applied to one surface and ca to the opposite surface. When brought together, they will bond instantly.

It has two separate gradient layers for higher particle reduction efficiency and dirt-loading capacity than standard spun or string-wound cartridges. The nominal filtration rating of the pre-filter layer is 25 microns, and the rating of the post-filter layer is 1 micron. The filter is made of spun polypropylene fibers for resistance to chemicals and bacteria. It has an initial pressure drop of less than 1 pound per square inch (psi) at a flow rate of 10 gallons per minute (gpm), and operates over a temperature range of 40 to 145 degrees F (4.4 to 62.8 degrees C). This spun polypropylene filter cartridge meets National Sanitation Foundation/American National Standards Institute (NSF/ANSI) standard 42 for quality assurance, and is used for treatment of residential, commercial, and municipal drinking water., The nominal filtration rating is for a particle removal efficiency of 85%., H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back., Water filters remove undesirable particles, chemicals, and microorganisms from water by means of a semipermeable barrier, adsorption, or biological processes. They are made of densely packed synthetic or natural fibers that trap suspended particles, materials that block microbes or adsorb unwanted chemicals, or substances that cause a chemical change, such as acid neutralization. For most residential, commercial, and industrial applications, water filters are manufactured in the form of replaceable cartridges that fit inside permanent housings. Filtration systems typically consist of a series of two or more types of filters, each designed to remove different contaminants. The performance of filters is measured by the minimum particle size that is blocked, the percentage of particles or microorganisms that are removed, the downstream concentration of unwanted chemicals, the maximum flow rate, and the amount of water that can be filtered before the filter must be replaced. Water filters are used in a wide range of applications, including drinking water purification, swimming pools, industrial processes, and irrigation, among others., Pentair manufactures industrial, commercial, and residential water filtration components and systems. The company, founded in 1966 and headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards 9001 and 14001 for quality assurance.","Reduces sand, silt, scale, and rust particles in residential, commercial, and municipal drinking water, Combines two separate gradient layers for higher efficiency and dirt-loading capacity, Spun polypropylene for resistance to chemicals and bacteria, Initial pressure drop of less than 1 psi at a flow rate of 10 gpm, Temperature range of 40 to 145 degrees F (4.4 to 62.8 degrees C).",Pentek,2612

White Gorilla Glue is a 100% waterproof glue, safe for indoor and outdoor use and strong enough to stand up to the elements. The white glue easily bonds foam, wood, metal, ceramic, stone and much more! White Gorilla Glue is a moisture activated adhesive. It is important to replace the cap tightly, and store in a cool, dry place. You should expect a year shelf life. Directions: If youre using White Gorilla Glue for the first time, we always recommend trying a test piece first. All surfaces must be clean, dust free and tight fitting. For shiny surfaces, such as metals, glass and some plastics, roughen up the material to give the glue something to bite into. Lightly dampen one surface with water. We recommend using a damp cloth or spraying with water. Do not saturate the surface. For dense hardwoods, lightly dampen both surfaces prior to gluing. Carefully apply a paper thin layer of White Gorilla Glue onto the other, dry surface. Do not over apply. We recommend wearing gloves or spreading the glue with a disposable brush. Clamp the two surfaces together tightly. Make sure the clamping pressure is distributed evenly across the surface. Or, if you dont have a clamp, use heavy objects or Gorilla Tape to achieve the appropriate clamping pressure. For lighter objects, try using rubber bands to hold the pieces together tightly. Clamp objects for 3060 minutes. For best results, allow 24 hours to cure. If you need to remove any uncured squeeze out or wet glue, we recommend wiping with a dry cloth or using a standard paint thinner.

The nominal filtration rating of the pre-filter layer is 25 microns, and the rating of the post-filter layer is 1 micron. The filter is made of spun polypropylene fibers for resistance to chemicals and bacteria. It has an initial pressure drop of less than 1 pound per square inch (psi) at a flow rate of 20 gallons per minute (gpm), and operates over a temperature range of 40 to 145 degrees F (4.4 to 62.8 degrees C). This spun polypropylene filter cartridge meets National Sanitation Foundation/American National Standards Institute (NSF/ANSI) standard 42 for quality assurance, and is used for treatment of residential, commercial, and municipal drinking water., The nominal filtration rating is for a particle removal efficiency of 85%., H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back., Water filters remove undesirable particles, chemicals, and microorganisms from water by means of a semipermeable barrier, adsorption, or biological processes. They are made of densely packed synthetic or natural fibers that trap suspended particles, materials that block microbes or adsorb unwanted chemicals, or substances that cause a chemical change, such as acid neutralization. For most residential, commercial, and industrial applications, water filters are manufactured in the form of replaceable cartridges that fit inside permanent housings. Filtration systems typically consist of a series of two or more types of filters, each designed to remove different contaminants. The performance of filters is measured by the minimum particle size that is blocked, the percentage of particles or microorganisms that are removed, the downstream concentration of unwanted chemicals, the maximum flow rate, and the amount of water that can be filtered before the filter must be replaced. Water filters are used in a wide range of applications, including drinking water purification, swimming pools, industrial processes, and irrigation, among others., Pentair manufactures industrial, commercial, and residential water filtration components and systems.

This single-row bearing is built to support radial loads and has a revolutions per minute (RPM) limit of 34,000 with greased lubrication. It is made from carbon steel for durability and resistance to deformity under heavy loads. This bearing is shielded on both sides to keep lubricant in and contaminants out. The 608ZZ bearing is suitable for use in such applications as skateboards, inline skates, and scooters and comes in a pack of eight., Rolling bearings use rolling elements to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. These elements can be one of the following types: ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindle, or tapered. All rolling bearings are open, shielded, or sealed. Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan. Rolling bearings are used in a range of applications from agricultural machinery to conveying equipment, robotics, dental equipment, elevators, rolling mills, ship rudder shafts, and aggregate crushers, among others.","Single-row bearing for supporting radial loads, Shields on both sides of the bearing to keep lubricant in and contaminants out, Carbon steel for durability and resistance to deformity under heavy loads, 34,000 rpm limit with grease lubrication, Dimensions suitable for use in such applications as skateboards, inline skates, and scooters",VXB,8701

This carbon block filter cartridge meets National Sanitation Foundation/American National Standards Institute (NSF/ANSI) standard 42 for quality assurance, and is used for purification of residential and commercial drinking water., The nominal filtration rating is for a particle removal efficiency of 85%. Chlorine reduction capacity is the minimum total amount of water for which the free available chlorine (FAC) at a concentration of 2 ppm is reduced by at least 90%., H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back., Water filters remove undesirable particles, chemicals, and microorganisms from water by means of a semipermeable barrier, adsorption, or biological processes. They are made of densely packed synthetic or natural fibers that trap suspended particles, materials that block microbes or adsorb unwanted chemicals, or substances that cause a chemical change, such as acid neutralization. For most residential, commercial, and industrial applications, water filters are manufactured in the form of replaceable cartridges that fit inside permanent housings. Filtration systems typically consist of a series of two or more types of filters, each designed to remove different contaminants. The performance of filters is measured by the minimum particle size that is blocked, the percentage of particles or microorganisms that are removed, the downstream concentration of unwanted chemicals, the maximum flow rate, and the amount of water that can be filtered before the filter must be replaced. Water filters are used in a wide range of applications, including drinking water purification, swimming pools, industrial processes, and irrigation, among others., Pentair manufactures industrial, commercial, and residential water filtration components and systems. The company, founded in 1966 and headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards 9001 and 14001 for quality assurance.","Reduces fine sediment and chlorine taste and odor in residential and commercial drinking water, Nominal filtration rating of 5 microns, Bonded PAC media with polyolefin pre-filter and polyethylene netting for extended life, Initial pressure drop of 4.3 psi at a flow rate of 2 gpm, Temperature range of 40 to 180 degrees F (4.4 to 82.2 degrees C)",Pentek,5607

This double thick adhesive tape surpasses ordinary duct tapes, making the list of uses virtually endless. Made with double thick adhesive, strong reinforced backing, and a tough all-weather shell, its the biggest, strongest, toughest thing ever to happen to duct tape. Gorilla Tape is manufactured with a highly concentrated rubber based adhesive  two to three times as thick as traditional duct tape. The result is a tape that fills gaps and penetrates rough surfaces. It sticks to rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes cant hold. To us, its made the way tape should be: The Toughest on Planet Earth. Directions: Use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla Tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. It is important to clean the surface and brush off any loose particles and dirt before applying Gorilla Tape. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. Thats it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla Tape! To retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla Tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess supply wrapped until theyre needed. Gorilla Tape works best at temperatures above 32F (0C). For best results, always apply the tape at room temperature. If Gorilla Tape freezes, it will work just fine once it returns to room temperature. Gorilla Tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. Gorilla Tape should not be used as an electrical tape.

It is made of strong plastic. This wrench fits the sumps of Pentek #10 Big Blue filter housings, which are used in a wide variety of applications, including drinking water purification, irrigation, and industrial processes, among others., Water filters remove undesirable particles, chemicals, and microorganisms from water by means of a semipermeable barrier, adsorption, or biological processes. They are made of densely packed synthetic or natural fibers that trap suspended particles, materials that block microbes or adsorb unwanted chemicals, or substances that cause a chemical change, such as acid neutralization. For most residential, commercial, and industrial applications, water filters are manufactured in the form of replaceable cartridges that fit inside permanent housings. Filtration systems typically consist of a series of two or more types of filters, each designed to remove different contaminants. The performance of filters is measured by the minimum particle size that is blocked, the percentage of particles or microorganisms that are removed, the downstream concentration of unwanted chemicals, the maximum flow rate, and the amount of water that can be filtered before the filter must be replaced. Water filters are used in a wide range of applications, including drinking water purification, swimming pools, industrial processes, and irrigation, among others., Pentair manufactures industrial, commercial, and residential water filtration components and systems.

Polycarbonate sheet may be decorated using a wide variety of modern techniques such as painting and screen printing. \n<br> \n<br> Unlike most thermoplastics, polycarbonate can undergo large plastic deformations without cracking or breaking. As a result, it can be processed and formed at room temperature using sheet metal techniques, such as forming bends on a brake. Even for sharp angle bends with a tight radius, no heating is generally necessary. This makes it valuable in prototyping applications where transparent or electrically non-conductive parts are needed, which cannot be made from sheet metal \n<br> \n<br> \n<b>Light transmission</b> \n<br> Transparent Polycarbonate sheet have excellent light transmission, dependent of thickness between 84 - 87%. \n<br> \n<br> \n<b>Fire performance</b> \n<br> Polycarbonate sheet has good fire behavior characteristics.

This safety valve has an 6 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) flow rate and is suitable for low flow pressure relief applications such as in tankless air compressors., Relief valves remove excess pressure or vacuum from a system. The valve openings allow fluids or gases to escape to decrease pressure, and then close once the valve reaches the reseating pressure limit. They also relieve excess vacuum by opening to release a gas into the system and then closing after it reaches its low-pressure limit. Some relief valves have an adjustment mechanism to set the pressure where the valve opens, making it suitable for various applications. Relief valves are rated according to the volume of liquid or gas that can flow through them and the material that the valve is constructed from must be suitable for the fluid or gas, which may be corrosive or at an extreme temperature, in which it operates.

The valve\s brass body, brass valve seat, and the zinc plated steel spring resist corrosion and can be used in operating temperatures up to 250 degrees F. The preset relief pressure is accurate to within +/- 3 percent and a silicon O-ring provides a leak-proof seal to within +/- 10 percent of the relief pressure. This safety valve is American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) safety rated and displays the UV mark for pressure vessel safety valves. It also displays the NB mark for certification in accordance with NB-501, National Board Certification of Pressure Relief Devices. This safety valve has a 116 cubic feet per minute (CFM) flow rate and is suitable for low capacity pressure relief applications such as in home construction air compressors., Relief valves remove excess pressure or vacuum from a system. The valve openings allow fluids or gases to escape to decrease pressure, and then close once the valve reaches the reseating pressure limit. They also relieve excess vacuum by opening to release a gas into the system and then closing after it reaches its low-pressure limit. Some relief valves have an adjustment mechanism to set the pressure where the valve opens, making it suitable for various applications. Relief valves are rated according to the volume of liquid or gas that can flow through them and the material that the valve is constructed from must be suitable for the fluid or gas, which may be corrosive or at an extreme temperature, in which it operates. Relief valves are used in a variety of applications, such as air compressors, petrochemical and chemical manufacturing, natural gas processing, and power generation., Control Devices manufactures valves and other flow control devices.

Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries., United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope.

In fact, the amount of advanced technology packed into the compact casework of the Zdac is impressive, and the level of performance is stunning.

Unique Re-Clocking System The Zdac sounds more natural and less andapos;digitalandapos; than DACs selling for far more because of its innovative design and high quality parts. Its unique re-clocking system preserves the original source audio data by eliminating jitter contamination that is picked up along the digital signal chain. This highly effective jitter-reduction system works on all inputs, not just the USB input, as in many other DACs. This is accomplished through the synergy of two premium parts, an Analog Devices AD1895 asynchronous sample rate converter and an AD1853 DAC IC, the same DAC IC that Holm selected for Parasoundandapos;s $5,000 Halo CD 1 CD player. To further improve sound quality the digital signal for all inputs is up-sampled to 422 kHz. The Zdac accepts 24 bit word lengths and all sampling rates up to 192 kHz on S/PDIF and Optical and 96 kHz on USB. Signals are reclocked and then upsampled to 422 kHz for vivid and effortless reproduction. andquot;We invite you to compare the Zdac to any DAC selling for under $1500,andquot; says Parasoundandapos;s President Richard Schram. andquot;You have our permission to buy a superior DAC without a high price.andquot;","Premium Analog Devices AD1853 24-bit/192 kHz Digital to Analog Converter IC, All inputs feature jitter reduction and are re-clocked and up-sampled to 422 kHz / 24 bit, Asynchronous USB input for playing music from PC or Mac (driver-less for easy setup), Works with any format file on your computer up to 96 kHz / 24 bit, RCA unbalanced and XLR balanced analog outputs",Parasound,285

Theyre great for stairs and other surfaces like curtains, upholstery, auto interiors, and more. What are the benefits to cleaning with the BISSELL Zing Bagged Canister Vacuum? BISSELL Zing bagged canister vacuum makes any cleaning task seem effortless. The lightweight design and carry handle provide portable convenience. The Multi-Surface Floor Nozzle allows for easy cleaning of carpet, rugs and bare floors. The telescoping wand allows you to comfortably maneuver around and under furniture and also clean hard to reach areas like drapes and ceilings. When you are finished, the cord will automatically rewind with the push of a button. What is the difference between an upright vacuum and a canister vacuum? Canister vacuums are low to the ground vacuums that have a long hose with a wand on the end. As you clean through the hose and wand, you pull the canister unit behind you. Upright vacuums stand tall and have a handle, which is used to push the vacuum. When cleaning carpets, the debris is removed through the foot or base of the unit. Most uprights also have a hose and on-board tools, which are typically used for hard to reach places and when cleaning furniture.At one time, canisters were thought to be easier to use for cleaning hard to reach places and for cleaning a larger variety of floors surfaces. However, the uprights of today have added cleaning features, such as bare floor height adjustments, brush roll on/off switches, and are easily maneuverable. In addition, the on board cleaning tools have made upright vacuums even more versatile.Although uprights are easier to use and more effective at cleaning larger areas in the home, they can still be a challenge when cleaning stairs. Which type of vacuum is better -- bagless or bagged? Neither type of vacuum is better than the other. A bagged vacuum will lose its cleaning effectiveness as the bag fills with debris. The bag must be changed when it is about 1/2 to 2/3 full for the best cleaning performance. The choice between a bagged and bagless vacuum really depends on your personal preference.

This can lead to direct exposure of individuals to radioactivity. The Pocket Geiger is an accessory for the iPhone/iPod/iPad which works with an accompanying, free downloadable App. The free App is called andquot;Pocket Geigerandquot;. To use the Pocket Geiger, you connect it to your iPhone audio output, load the App, and let it use its photodiode sensors to detect nearby radiation. In this way, you can know whether or not you are in a safe area. The level of radiation is expressed as an amount of radiation in Sievert (Sv) per hour of exposure. Average individual background radiation dose for Americans is 0.34 uSv/h. Pocket Geiger has four models: Type 2, Type 3 for iOs and for Android and Type 4. Type 2 or type 4, the power is supplied by the iPhone headphone output, no battery is needed. However, Type 2 and Type 4 do NOT support Apple iOS devices sold in Europe. Type 4 is the next generation of Type 2 for Apple iOS device only with Ultra High Sensitivity. The measuring time needed for a stable reading for Type 4 has been reduced from 15 minutes to 2 minutes. Type 3 works for both Apple iOS and Android devices and the power is supplied by a 9V external battery. Please note that the iPhone in the picture is not included and the Pocket Geiger can detect X ray and Gamma Ray only. Radiation is colorless, odorless and tasteless. It is impossible to tell whether you are being exposed and, if so, to how much, unless you have a Geiger counter or similar device. We believe that everyone should have the right to know the correct radiation level in a given location. Right now a mother or father has no way of making sure whether the park nearby is safe for her or his child to play. In the past, it was hard to get a Geiger counter even if we wanted one, costing hundreds of dollars to buy. Because of this, Radiation-watch.org has developed a survey meter that is both reliable and affordable.","Product Name: Smart Radiation Detector Pocket Geiger Type 4, Supported Device: iPhone 3GS/4/4S and 5, iPad 1/2/3 and mini, iPod 2/3/4 and 5.

Nontoxic water-soluble paint provides a new way to engage in electronics. Paint dries at room temperature and is suitable as a cold solder. Teach resistance, circuitry, polarity, or voltage in a fun, creative way. Works with electrical components, prototyping materials, PCBs, microcontrollers, e-textiles, and conductive thread. Includes application and storing instructions, but no lab activities. Use paint within 6 months of opening. Remove from most surfaces using soap and water. Circuit components such as LEDs, alligator clips, transistors, meters, batteries, or power source (up to 12-V DC) are sold separately. The thinner the layer of paint the faster it dries. Also, conductivity increases as the paint dries. Allow drying time before testing projects. Surface resistivity is approximately 55 _/sq at 50  layer thickness. Only available in black but retains its properties even if coated with another material. This creates a great opportunity for exploiting its material characteristics by using it as a graphical element alongside other colors.

It sticks to rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes cant hold. To us, its made the way tape should be: The Toughest on Planet Earth. Directions: Use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla Tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. It is important to clean the surface and brush off any loose particles and dirt before applying Gorilla Tape. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. Thats it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla Tape! To retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla Tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess supply wrapped until theyre needed. Gorilla Tape works best at temperatures above 32F (0C). For best results, always apply the tape at room temperature. If Gorilla Tape freezes, it will work just fine once it returns to room temperature. Gorilla Tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. Gorilla Tape should not be used as an electrical tape.

B00E1P6752,Parasound Zdac V2 Digital to Analog Converter - Silver,"Industrial and Scientific, Industrial Electrical, Semiconductor Products, Signal Components, Signal Converters","With the original Zdac, Parasound set a new standard for D to A converter performance and value. The new Zdac v.2 builds on the Zdac\s widely acclaimed sound quality with important new features. Parasound has added a separate analog volume control for its line outputs so you can now connect the Zdac v.2 directly to a power amp and save the expense of a preamplifier. And Parasound made the headphone amp even more potent with both 1/8"" and 1/4"" headphone jacks and its own volume control. The Zdac v.2 has a 12V trigger input so that it can be turned on and off automatically and a powered 12V output to trigger a power amp on and off. A rear panel variable-fixed switch for the line outputs lets you select variable output for when the Zdac v.2 drives a power amp directly, or a fixed output level for when it drives a separate preamp or whole-house audio system. The Zdac v.2 sounds natural and less \digital\ than more expensive DACs thanks to Parasound\s asynchronous sample rate converter. A precise re-clocking system eliminates bitstream-contaminating jitter that\s picked up along the digital signal chain. Unlike many other DACs, the Zdac v.2 eliminates jitter on all of its inputs, not only the USB input. The Zdac v.2 headphone amp is based on the superior Texas Instruments TPA6120. Its current-feedback design and extremely high slew rate prevent odd order distortions and any trace of listening fatigue. Virtually instantaneous response to musical dynamics doesn\t come at the expense of its noise floor or signal to noise ratio. Its output impedance is very low and its high gain drives even 600 ohms cans with ease. The Zdac v.2 accepts 24 bit word lengths and all sampling rates up to 192 kHz on S/PDIF and Optical and 96 kHz on USB. Signals are reclocked and then upsampled to 422 kHz for vivid and effortless reproduction.","Analog volume control for RCA and XLR outputs, Separate volume control for the headphone jacks, Digital audio connection to Lighting-jack equipped Apple device (USB adapter required), Updated headphone amp with increased gain, USB input for playing music from PC, Mac or Linux",Parasound,297

For example, if youre using an Arduino, simply connect the VDD pin to the 5V voltage pin, GND to ground, SCL to I2C Clock (Analog 5 on an UNO) and SDA to I2C Data (Analog 4 on an UNO). Then download our MPL3115A2 Arduino library and example code for temperature, pressure and basic altitude calculation. Install the library, and load the example sketch. Immediately youll have the temperature, pressure and altitude data printed in the serial console.<br><br>""","Adafruit Part Number: 1893, Stock Type: Sensors andgt;andgt; Barometric Pressure, In Stock and Ready to Ship",Adafruit,5481

We found the best color sensor on the market, the TCS34725, which has RGB and Clear light sensing elements. An IR blocking filter, integrated on-chip and localized to the color sensing photodiodes, minimizes the IR spectral component of the incoming light and allows color measurements to be made accurately. The filter means youand#39;ll get much truer color than most sensors, since humans donand#39;t see IR. The sensor also has an incredible 3,800,000:1 dynamic range with adjustable integration time and gain so it is suited for use behind darkened glass.<br /><br />We add supporting circuitry as well, such as a 3.3V regulator so you can power the breakout with 3-5VDC safely and level shifting for the I2C pins so they can be used with 3.3V or 5V logic. Finally, we specified a nice neutral 4150anddeg;K temperature LED with a MOSFET driver onboard to illuminate what youand#39;re trying to sense. The LED can be easily turned on or off by any logic level output.<br /><br />Connect to any microcontroller with I2C and our example code will quickly get you going with 4 channel readings. We include some example code to detect light lux and temperature that we snagged from the eval board software.<br /><br /> A detailed tutorial is here , check out our Arduino library and follow our tutorial to install . Wire up the sensor by connecting VDD to 3-5VDC, Ground to common ground, SCL to I2C Clock and SDA to I2C Data on your Arduino.

Unlike other construction adhesives, its 100% adhesive formula provides a long-lasting, heavy duty bond. We call it All Surface, All Purpose. The durable, 100% waterproof formula holds up indoors and out and bonds virtually anything including subfloor, mirrors, trim, drywall, landscaping, bath surrounds, foam board, marble and more. Directions: All surfaces should be clean and free of dirt, grease and oil. Best if used above 40F. 1. Unscrew nozzle, cut tip of cartridge, replace nozzle and cut to desired bead size. Insert into cartridge gun. 2. Apply adhesive to one surface in a zig-zag pattern or inside perimeter of the object. Be careful of squeeze-out. When working on rough, uneven surfaces, use enough adhesive to fill gaps. 3. Within 10 minutes, press surfaces together and hold for 20-30 seconds. NOTE: Heavy items may require temporary support. Use in conjunction with mechanical fasteners when hanging large mirrors. 4. Allow 24 hours to cure. Note that cure times will increase with lower temperature, humidity and if bonding non-porous surfaces. Gorilla Construction Adhesive is best if stored in a cool, dry location, with the nozzle attached filled with adhesive. The best way to store Gorilla Construction Adhesive for reuse is to leave the nozzle filled with adhesive attached to the cartridge between uses. The adhesive left in the nozzle acts as a cap and seals the material in the cartridge. If the cartridge is reused within a few days, the nozzle can be removed and the plugged material can be poked out and then reused. If it has been more than a few days, the easiest way to reuse, is the cut the nozzle farther to eliminate the plugged material.

B011XWDTOW,"Bob Smith Industries BSI-142 Clear Foam-Cure, Craft Glue, 4 oz.","Industrial and Scientific, Tapes, Adhesives and Sealants, Silicone Adhesives","FOAM-CURE is a silicone based adhesive that works very well on EPP and EPO foams. It is crystal clear and cures to a more flexible consistency than CA. It is, however, not instant bonding like CA and there is no accelerator to speed its curing. To obtain a faster initial bond when bonding two pieces, FOAM-CURE can be applied to one piece and after the two are joined, they can then be pulled apart. After letting it air dry for about ten minutes, FOAM-CURE will act like a contact cement when the parts are rejoined, resulting in enough tack strength to allow the next steps of assembly. Full strength is reached in 10-12 hours. FOAM-CURE works with all foams, and will actually bond most other materials. It will bond wood and plastic to foam, and is a good canopy glue. FOAM-CURE does not, however, cure flexible enough to act as a hinge for aircraft control surfaces. Its limitations occur when bonding large areas of two non-porous materials. FOAM-CURE requires exposure to air for drying. If one tried to bond, for example, a half-dollar coin to glass, over 90% of the adhesive would never cure, since the solvent it contains would have no where to evaporate. A small amount of denatured alcohol can be mixed into the Foam-Cure to make it thinner. Directions in 5 different languages.","Made in the USA, Compatible with all foams, Dries crystal clear, Overnight cure for full strength, Proud Sponsors of Wounded Warrior Project",Bob Smith Industries,3173

One side is felt, and the other side has adhesive. Commonly used for joining and temporarily repairing fabric, curtains and cloth drapes in backdrops and for other general use vibration dampening. Felt material is also used for filtration applications, gaskets, wipers, and padding in a wide variety of industries.

Application Instructions On many of the adhesive felt products the rolls will have an approximately 2 inch to 4 inch leader of double-sided film tape applied to the release liner before the felt material starts. We recommend you either cut a small piece of felt off at the beginning of the roll with a pair of scissors to start, or peel the double-sided film tape off of the release liner to use as a way to begin applying the felt (try not to pull the double-sided film tape off of the felt backing though).

B015TRZTFY,Texas Instruments NE555P IC Single Precision Timer (Pack of 12),"Industrial and Scientific, Industrial Electrical","The NE555 are precision timing circuits capable of producing accurate time delays or oscillation. In the time-delay or mono-stable mode of operation, the timed interval is controlled by a single external resistor and capacitor network. In the a-stable mode of operation, the frequency and duty cycle can be controlled independently with two external resistors and a single external capacitor. The threshold and trigger levels normally are two-thirds and one-third, respectively, of VCC. These levels can be altered by use of the control-voltage terminal. When the trigger input falls below the trigger level, the flip-flop is set, and the output goes high. If the trigger input is above the trigger level and the threshold input is above the threshold level, the flip-flop is reset and the output is low. The reset (RESET) input can override all other inputs and can be used to initiate a new timing cycle. When RESET goes low, the flip-flop is reset, and the output goes low. When the output is low, a low-impedance path is provided between discharge (DISCH) and ground. The output circuit is capable of sinking or sourcing current up to 200 mA. Operation is specified for supplies of 5 V to 15 V. With a 5-V supply, output levels are compatible with TTL inputs.","Timing From Microseconds to Hours, Astable or Monostable Operation, TTL-Compatible Output Can Sink or Source Up to 200 mA, Adjustable Duty Cycle, Operation is specified for supplies of 5 V to 15 V",Texas Instruments,2690

When cutting, consider applying the proper amount of pressure at a 90 degree angle to allow the cutting wheel to do the work. For best results, consider not pushing too hard on the wheel, which can cause the grinder to stall or kick back or give a less efficient cutting action, while also increasing the chances of slippage or loss of control of the tool, resulting in injury or damage. Applying light to moderate pressure and consistent movement will provide the most efficient cut and minimize heat build-up. Consider using light pressure and a consistent motion throughout the cut for the fastest cut-rate and prolonged wheel life. Excessive pressure through the cut causes increased friction and heat build-up, which can cause increased heat discoloration of the work piece and reduced wheel life. For demanding applications, higher amperage and/or torque angle grinders provide easier, long-lasting and efficient cuts.","10 MAKITA Premium 4-1/2 Type 1 Flat Cut Off Wheels for Metal and Stainless Steel (INOX) | 4-1/2-Inch x .045-Inch x 7/8-Inch | Optimized for Makita 4-1/2 Angle Grinders and compatible with All 4-1/2 Angle Grinders with 5/8 arbor, CUT 2-3X MORE than lower quality or excessively thin wheels due to this wheels Carefully selected Grain Grit, Hard Bond Matrix and Wheel Thickness that provide the best balanced Cut Life, Cut Rate, Cut Precision, Power Demands and Heat Buildup in the industry, allowing you to cut longer, consistently precise with unmatched wheel integrity, moderate power demands and relatively low heat buildup, QUICKLY and Effortlessly Cut through All Metal, Steel and Stainless Steel parts including rebar, steel pipe, structural and galvanized steel, sheet metal, structural tubing, black steel, cable and small to medium diameter solid pieces over an extra-long life span due to Makitas High-performance aluminum oxide grain and proprietary hard bond matrix, AVOID WHEEL SHATTER and Injury with lower priced wheels by relying on Makitas proprietary strong Synthetic Resinoid Bond matrix that binds Premium White Aluminum Oxide with Phenol Resin, allowing for optimal grain wear which yields accurate cutting PERFORMANCE, PRECISION, LONGEVITY, STABILITY and INTEGRITY, cutting Longer, Faster and Reliably than other wheels that may shatter or prematurely wear, DESIGNED for hard and continuous use on Stainless Steel, these Makita wheels are Quality Assured, Contaminant-Free, containing less than 0.1% Iron, Sulfur or Chlorine, for rust and corrosion-free results for your Stainless Steel material",Makita,7657

Proto-pastas high Temp PLA v2.0 is everything the original Kick starter version should have been. This new formulation is higher performing, more obviously heat treatable, and lower cost. This tough PLA prints with ease but has a potential heat deflection temperature (hot) of as much as 140C (285F) depending on post-processing. This means parts retain more stiffness and form at higher temperatures (no warping on your sunny car dashboard). For maximum performance, your prints should be heat treated (i.e. Crystallized) in an oven until you see a change from translucent to opaque. Yes, there is an obvious visual change indicating the improved performance! We had good luck in a lab oven at 110C (230F) for an hour or less. We recommend leaving the supports on your parts, placing them on a non-radiating surface (like glass, ceramic, or composite), and letting them cool in the oven to minimize distortion. Parts can be baked at a lower temperature (though must be above 60C for any change to occur) for a longer.

As seen in pictures.  Sweet Stocking stuffer, Christmas gift  Great chemistry gift  Amazing science gift  Teacher gift The Facts Boron (atomic number 5) This sample is ideal for element collectors on the cheap or those conducting experiments. Boron is a silvery-black metalloid. Boron Nitrides hardness is second only to diamond, but it has better thermal (melting point of 3,767F) of and chemical stability, hence boron nitride ceramics are used in high-temperature equipment. Boron is an essential nutrient for all green plants. Boron in its crystalline form is very unreactive. Amorphous boron is reactive. Boron is used to dope silicon and germanium semiconductors, modifying their electrical properties. Boron oxide (B2O3) is used in glassmaking and ceramics. Borax (Na2B4O7.10H2O) is used in making fiberglass, as a cleansing fluid, a water softener, insecticide, herbicide and disinfectant. Boron compounds such as borax (sodium tetraborate, Na2B4O710H2O) have been known and used by ancient cultures for thousands of years.  Boron does not generally make ionic bonds, it forms stable covalent bonds. Boron can transmit portions of infrared light.  Borons conductivity improves markedly at higher temperatures.  Boron carbide (B4C) is used in tank armor and bullet proof vests.  Boron nitride nanotubes can have a similar structure to carbon nanotubes. BN nanotubes are more thermally and chemically stable than carbon nanotubes and, unlike carbon nanotubes, boron nitride nanotubes are electrical insulators. This is high quality yet cheap affordable Boron Safety / Caution Keep out of reach from children!
