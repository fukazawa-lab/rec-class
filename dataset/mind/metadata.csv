N24146,Ash Falls From Smoky Sky in Bushfire-Hit New South Wales,weather,"As New South Wales, Australia, continued to deal with some of the state's worst-ever bushfires, skies above the state were filled with smoky haze, even in areas far from the biggest blazes. Michael Jardine was at home in Avoca Beach on November 12 when he noticed ash and burned leaves falling from the hazy sky. He told Storyful, ""Historically, where we are in Avoca, there have been no major issues with bushfires."" Although largely unaffected by the fires, the closest of which was a two-hour drive away, Avoca Beach did close its public school on November 12. Jardine said he believed the debris seen in the video was blowing in from the Gospers Mountain fire, which had reached 35,000 hectares (about 86,500 acres) at that point. As of November 14, the NSW Rural Fire Service reported 61 fires were still burning across New South Wales, 35 of which were yet to be contained. The organization warned of an increased risk on November 15, with eight parts of the state classified as being under very high or severe fire danger. The national death toll from the catastrophic event has risen to four as firefighters battled blazes across two states.
